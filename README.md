Phantasy Star Online Mag Feeder

The purpose of this project is to essentially emulate Phantasy Star
Online's mag feeding mechanics. It essentially will act as a calculator,
allowing users incrementally feed a mag and level them up. It will also
allow users to figure out exactly what they need to feed their mags to 
get them to specific evolutions, or maximize stat potential.
